# ECON860_final

## Description
This program is a python script designed to analyze the relationship between personality traits and math ability among a dataset of 21,644 individuals. The project consists of several tasks, including factor analysis, clustering, and predictive modeling. Please refer to the "Answers" section for detailed step-by-step instructions on running the Python code and completing the project tasks.

## Dependencies 
'pandas' is a library that is used for data manipulation. This helps us create and manage data frames. 
'Matplotlib' a library allowing used to create a variety of visualizations for data.
'Factor_Analyzer' is a library allowing for the performance of explorator and factor analysis 
'Numpy' is a library that adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
'Scikit-learn' is a library adding simple tools for predictive data analysis 
'Scikit-learn-extra'  is a library for machine learning that extends scikit-learn. It includes algorithms that are useful but are not in 'Scikit-learn'

## Usage
To utilize the code for the ECON860 final project, begin by cloning or downloading this GitHub repository to your local machine. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and install the required dependencies. Prepare your dataset and additional data files and place them in the project directory. Open the proper Python script, modify it as needed for your specific dataset, and execute the analysis tasks, which may include factor analysis, clustering, or predictive modeling. Depending on your question, you will need to open and run separate .py files. For factor analysis, please use "Main.py". For clustering, please use "Clustering.py". For predictive modeling, please use 'Regressions.py".  Review the results generated by the code, such as reports or visualizations. 

## Answers
Part E: In the case of the final project, Kmean clustering gave a better result than the Gaussian mixture model. We know this because the Silhouette score for Kmean clustering was higher, indicating that the clusters were better defined and more well-separated. 

Part G: Linear regression gave the better result. The R^2 value for linear regression was ~.8, which is very strong. When running the logistic regression the accuracy score comes out to ~ 0.10, indicating that the model may not be very accurate. Another reason why linear regression is better is becuase it is used when the dependent variable is continuous and numeric, like our math scores here. 

Part H: I would begin by analyzing the factor loading to determine which questions are closely related to math ability, and rank each question by its score. I would also use linear regression as a way to test the predictive power of each question on math ability.I would then choose the top 20 questions with the highest factor loadings. I would use these questions to administer a new survey to the population. I would collect the responses from the survey, and perform another factor analysis on the new data and rank each individual on their traits related to math ability. The top 30 will be selected.  

Part I: Yes the answer is different from the previous questions. I would begin in a  similar fashion, using factor loading to help determine individuals who have a balance of a variety personality traits. I would seleect my 20 questions based on which capture the broadest range of personality traits. However here I would use clustering techniques to help me group individuals based on their responses to the survey. 

Part M: I do not believe that, although it is possible, using the questionaire answers themselves to predict math ability is a good idea. This is becuase the questionaire assesses personality traits and not math ability. Using these answers to directly predict math ability could lead to inaccurate results. By regressing math ability on each question it is possible to determine whether some personality questions are related to math ability. Using factor analysis is the best option
